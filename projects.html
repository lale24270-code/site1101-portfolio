            <h3>Building logic gates</h3>
            <p>
              This team-based academic project was completed as part of the SITE 1101 course
              <em>Principles of Information Systems</em>. The goal of the project was to understand
              how basic digital logic works at the hardware level by constructing fundamental
              logic gates using physical electronic components.
            </p>
            <p>During the lab sessions, we built and tested three basic logic gates — NOT, AND,
               and OR — using transistors, resistors, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a solderless
               breadboard. The project helped me better understand how logical operations are
               implemented in hardware and how software-level logic is grounded in physical
               circuits.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Learning Outcomes:</strong></p>
            <ul><li>Understanding how NOT, AND, and OR gates work in hardware</li>
                <li>Hands-on experience with breadboards and electronic components</li>
                <li>Basic principles of digital logic and signal flow</li>
                <li>Team collaboration in a laboratory environment</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Tools & Components:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Solderless breadboard</li>
                <li>NPN transistors (PN2222)</li>
                <li>Resistors and LEDs</li>
                <li>Pushbuttons and jumper wires</li>
                <li>Power supply module</li>

            <h3>Hour of Code(Hour of AI)</h3>
            <p>
              As part of this project, our team traveled to a secondary school in Jalilabad, where we conducted an Hour of Code / Hour of AI lesson for seventh-grade students. The goal of the session was to introduce students to the basics of programming, algorithms, and logical thinking in an engaging and accessible way.
            </p>
            <p>During the lesson, we used interactive and visual tools, including Microsoft MakeCode, to explain how simple algorithms work and how coding blocks can be combined to create programs. The activities were designed to match the students’ age and knowledge level, allowing everyone to actively participate and learn through practice.</p>
            <p>We were very warmly welcomed by the school administration and students, which created a friendly and positive learning environment. The students showed great interest, enthusiasm, and curiosity throughout the lesson, actively asking questions and participating in discussions.</p>
            <p>Each team member took part in teaching, guiding students, and providing individual support during the activities. At the end of the session, participants received certificates, making the experience both educational and motivating.</p>
            <p>This project helped us improve our teamwork, communication, and presentation skills while making a meaningful contribution to the community by promoting digital literacy and interest in computer science among school students.</p>
